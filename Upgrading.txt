
1. If you are upgrading bf2statistics from a previous version, Make sure you replace the OLD ASP and PYTHON files with the new ones. There are many
    changes to the way snapshots are built and read from the backend so the old asp and python files WILL NOT WORK. Also, Old snapshot files will
    not import correctly with the new ASP due to these changes... you have been warned ;)
    
2. Once you have replaced all of your ASP files, go ahead and open it up and login. If you get an error saying "You are NOT Authorised to access this 
    Page! (Ip: '...')", then you need to add your Ip address to the config file manually before continueing... Open the config.php file ( ASP/system/config/ ), 
    Look for "$admin_hosts = array( ... )" add your servers IP address to that list... make sure to follow the format (EI: add a comma and put the IP in 
    quotes).
    
3. Open the "System" navigation pane, and click "Edit Configuration". Edit the DB settings to match your bf2stats database.

4. Return the the Dashboard, and you should now see the Navigation link to "Upgrade Database". Make sure you have a backup of your current DB before 
    continuing!
    
5. Confirm the Upgrade.

6. Next, Click "Test System". Confirm the test and review the result for any errors :)

NOTE: Make sure you replace your servers python folder! the old python files will not work with 1.5.0!
